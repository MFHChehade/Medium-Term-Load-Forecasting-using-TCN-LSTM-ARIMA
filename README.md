# Medium-Term-Load-Forecasting-using-TCN-LSTM-ARIMA
The work develops a multi-step time series load forecasting model that predicts daily power consumption for the upcoming week based on historic daily data of consumption at a university campus.

The work designs a temporal convolutional network (TCN) model and compares its performance to the conventional Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and well-known Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) models. 

The results show the superiority of the TCN model.

The long-term objective of this project is to organize fuel supply for the diesel-oil powerplant at the American University of Beirut campus.

The two spreadsheets contain the data needed, the 2 PDF files contain a full report and a presentation, and the 3 notebooks are for each model.
