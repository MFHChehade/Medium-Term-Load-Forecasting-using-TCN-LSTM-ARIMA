# Medium-Term Load Forecasting using TCN, LSTM, ARIMA

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of medium-term load forecasting using three different methods: Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). The goal is to forecast electrical energy usage based on historical data and weather conditions.

## Notebooks
- `Arima.ipynb`: Implementation and results of the ARIMA model for load forecasting.
- `LSTM.ipynb`: Implementation and results of the LSTM model for load forecasting.
- `TCN.ipynb`: Implementation and results of the TCN model for load forecasting.

## Data
- `Temperature.csv`: Temperature data used as a feature in load forecasting.
- `building-electrical-energy-daily-use-ubcv-2019-2021.csv`: Electrical energy consumption data from 2019 to 2021.

## Documentation
- `Presentation.pptx.pdf`: A presentation summarizing the project findings and methodology.
- `Report.pdf`: Detailed report containing the analysis, results, and methodology of the forecasting models.
